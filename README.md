# TBNBT: The Better NBT library for Java
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MrYurihi/TBNBT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MrYurihi/TBNBT)  
TBNBT is an NBT library for Java that is very user friendly and quick to use.

__Features__

 - NBT Input & Output streams that read from a GZIP stream to decompress files
 - POJO serialization & deserialization for easy access to NBT
 - NBTTag classes that have usage similarities to the types the NBT represents in Java

__Goal__

Many NBT libraries are very hard to use, many include unnecessary complexity when it comes to using the provided classes.  
That is why TBNBT is  __T__ he __B__ etter __NBT__ library. All of the classes are very easy to use, including the serialization classes.  
TBNBT has NBT Adapter & NBT Adapter Factories to use for (de)serializing custom objects
